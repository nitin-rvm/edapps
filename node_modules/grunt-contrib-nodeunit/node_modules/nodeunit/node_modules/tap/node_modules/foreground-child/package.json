Exit\nwhen it exits.\n\nMostly this module is here to support some use cases around wrapping\nchild processes for test coverage and such.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```\nvar foreground = require('foreground-child')\n\n// cats out this file\nvar child = foreground('cat', [__filename])\n\n// At this point, it's best to just do nothing else.\n// return or whatever.\n// If the child gets a signal, or just exits, then this\n// parent process will exit in the same way.\n```\n",
